Bython (BioPython) is a python package to do computation on biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, small molecules etc. It is an effort to better organize my existing code along with new functionalities into one comprehensive package.

The code is under active development and the functionalities introduced so far have been tested locally. Please leave a comment (kapoor.abhijeet@gmail.com) if you have any suggestions, or report an issue if you find some bugs.

EXPECTED FEATURES IN NEXT UPDATE
	Error estimates for SIFT
	Deep-learning module for trajectory analysis.

RECENT UPDATES
	October 2019
		Added 7-bit SIFT calculation between protein-protein residues.
		Fixed a bug in ligand-protein SIFT aromatic calculation.

Bython (BioPython) is a python package to do computation on biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, small molecules etc. It is an effort to better organize my existing code (developed during my PhD) along with new functionalities into one comprehensive package.

The code is under active development and no way near completion. The functionalities introduced so far have been tested locally. Please leave a comment if you find any bugs, or have some suggestions.

TO DO:
	1) Complete OBcontact implementation.
	2) Add ipython docs
